# PT-Reddit

Project for school.<br>
Page has basic crud operations for 2 types of data (users and sites), for ratings it's only CR

## stack and tech

We used both server side rendering ( for panel ), and client side rendering (for site details, index, filtering data)
<br>
<br>Database: SQL (Maria DB)
<br>Backend: node JS (v20.5.1) with express
<br>Frontend: JS, CSS3, HTML5

### Setting app by yourself

<br>
Requirements: Node js, npm, something for database (we used Xampp)<br>
You have to install packages (npm i), activate Xampp, and do npm start.<br><br>
Aso add process.env file with structure: <br><br>
DATABASE= db name <br>
PASSWORD= User's password <br>
USR= name of user (in db) <br>
HOST= user's host <br>
SERVER_PORT = Port <br>

### Database structure

We added file for it (look in "setup" folder)
